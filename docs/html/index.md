> It's elementary my dear Watson

Watson is an easy to use framework designed to get out of your way and let you code your application rather than spend time wrangling with the framework. It follows the convention over configuration ideal, although the convention can be overriden if required. Out of the box it comes with a standard set of defaults to allow you to get coding straight away!


### Requirements
Watson is designed for Python 3.3 and up.

### Dependencies
Watson currently requires the following modules to work out of box:

* [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/) <span class="sub">For view templating</span>

These will be installed automatically if you have installed Watson via pip.

### Optional Dependencies
Some packages within Watson require third party packages to run correctly, these include:

* Memcached <span class="sub">pip package: python3-memcached</span>
* Redis <span class="sub">pip package: redis</span>

Notes about these dependencies can be found within the relevant documentation in the [Reference Library](/reference-library).
