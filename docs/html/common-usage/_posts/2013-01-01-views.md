Views within Watson are considered 'dumb' in that they do not contain any business or application logic within them. The only valid 'logic' that should be contained within a view would be simple for loops, if statements, and similar constructs.

The templating engine prefered by Watson is [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/), however this can easily be switched to another engine if required.

{% highlight python %}
views = {
    'renderers': {
        'default': {
            'name': 'my_new_renderer',
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

`my_new_renderer` needs to be configured within the IocContainer to instantiate the new renderer.


### Specifying different response formats

To output the response in different formats is quite a simple task and only involves modifying the route itself (it can be modified without changing the route, however this is not really encouraged).

{% highlight python %}
routes = {
    'home': {
        'path': '/',
        'defaults': {
            'format': 'json'
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

and the subsequent controller...

{% highlight python %}
from watson.mvc import controllers

class Public(controllers.Rest):
    def GET(self):
        return {'hello': 'world'}
{% endhighlight %}

The user can also be made responsible for determining the response format by correctly defining the route to support this. This is particularly useful if you're creating an API and need to support multiple formats such as XML and JSON.

{% highlight python %}
routes = {
    'home': {
        'path': '/something.:format',
        'requires': {
            'format': 'json|xml'
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above route, any request being sent to /something.xml or /something.json will output the data in the requested format.
